# ü§ëDiscord-backerü§ë
A open-source Discord member backup and restore tool for your server.
This can help you get all your members in 5 Seconds back after a raid if someone destroyed your server.


üõëIMPORTANTüõë:What you will need is a discord bot, a discord application, and a server.



# AUTOMATED Setup
Run oauth.py enter your DISCORD USER TOKEN and it will fetch all data aswell you need to start the setup.py credits to @swishyw

# 1. Setup
First, we are gonna need your discord bot token, Client ID, Client Secret.
This we can do at the [discord developers site](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
Now we are gonna make a new application

Once we have our application set up, we are gonna click on OAuth2, here we will find our Client ID, Secret Token, and our redirect URL. These we will need for later so save them.

For now, we are done here.

## Installation FLASK API PART 1
This will be very easy

First install the requirements: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
, open up setup.py in there we will need to input 4 things: CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, CLIENT_TOKEN (this is the bot token) , DOMAIN, welcome_channel, Member-role. 


If you want to test some stuff or add some go ahead but be sure to leave a like.
Now it will ask you if you want to start the API say yes.

## Installation Discord bot PART 2
INFO‚ùó: You can make your own discord bot if you want this whole process is API-based so if you want you can even make a telegram bot whatever you wish suits you best.

We are now going to open bot.py
Now we are going to enter the domain the Bot will automaticly fetch all details. It will start after automatic.

## Starting the system
If you want you can copy the files to your server to run there or leave it on your PC


first, we are gonna make a flask server if you don't know how to [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goToXTC96Co&t=3266s) 


After flask server deployment running your gonna run the bot:
```bash
python bot.py
```

Now your all set.
You will need to set your server so you can only see channels if you have the verified role

To restore the users do:
```
!restore YOURRESTOREKEY
```
Now all users will be back added.

# Endnote
Please leave a like this took lots of time to code and it wasn't easy.

# Update roadmap
These are the plans what I am trying to add.

- Web GUI for restoring/backuping the members
- Telegram bot For restoring/backuping

DONE:
- Easier instalation, via batch or via linux instalation file

# Advanced
This is for the PRO coders
You can edit the discordauth HTML template if you want. It is located in the folder template

Also this system is API based so you can also make your own discord bot if you want.
